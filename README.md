🔗 AlaJS — Automated Link Attribution
===

**AlaJS** is a simple and light (*less than 750B*) snippet that adds the **source link of a copied text** on a web page.

When a user copies a text on a webpage running this snippet and pastes it,
the copied text will contain `[Source: website/page-url]` at the end of it.

This will **help your SEO** because you can get more **backlinks and more visitors**.

Also, **you will be rightfully credited** for your work.

📝 Installation
---

You can install it via CDN.

**Specific version link**
`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marcocianetti/alajs@1.0.0/lib/index.min.js`

**Last version link** (*you should not use this for production*):
`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marcocianetti/alajs/lib/index.min.js`

❓ Why?
---

I needed this snippet for my [personal website](https://marcocianetti.com) so I decided to make it public.
Also, I found someone that is selling these 3 lines of codes for *49$/month* and I didn't find it very fair.

⚙️ How it works?
---

As I said is pretty simple, it uses the *copy* event and edits the clipboard data adding the current page URL.

🤔 What happens if they remove my link from pasted text?
---

You're not gonna get that link, of course.

This snippet **is not giving you any garantee** on keeping your link on copy-pasted text,
but when I found a website with this feature for the first time, and I copy-pasted its content,
well I just left its source link on that text because I found it ok, "it deserves to be cited".

It's up to your users.

If you want to support me you can offer me a cup of coffee,
so I can stay awake fixing (and creating) bugs all night long 🤓☕️
